### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few Friday Night Funkin' Projects, some of which have other very talented people on them, I'd recommend checking them out once I'm done
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Haxe, Lua and (hopefully) Rust and C+
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me anything, I can't guarantee I will have a correct answer, but I will have one for sure.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: through Discord, @BeastlyGhost#9035
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him (but it really doesn't matter for me honestly)
