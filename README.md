### Hi there, the name is "Gabriela", but call me "Gabi" or "Ghost"! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a transsexual man and hobbyist programmer

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few Friday Night Funkin' Projects, some of which have other very talented people on them, I'd recommend checking them out once I'm done
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Haxe, Lua and (hopefully) Rust and C+
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything, I can't guarantee I will have a correct answer, but I will have one for sure.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: through Discord, @BeastlyGhost#9035, as an alternative (less likely to receive replies), Twitter: @Fan_de_RPG
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her (I often don't care about pronouns that much though)
