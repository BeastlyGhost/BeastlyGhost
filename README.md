### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few FNF Projects, some of which have other very talented coders on them, I'd recommend checking them out!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haxe, Lua and (hopefully) Rust and C+
- 💬 Ask me about literally anything, I can't guarantee I will have a correct answer, but an answer? maybe...
- 📫 How to reach me: through Discord, @BeastlyGhost∞#9035
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him (but it really doesn't matter for me honestly)
